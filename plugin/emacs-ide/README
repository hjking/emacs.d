The purpose is to provide a user-friendly interface, with dedicated windows
(source, menu and output) and convenient shortcuts.

It is suitable for almost all languages (as long as they are supported by

        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |       "source" window                   | "menu" window |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        |                                                         |
        |               "output" window                           |
        |                                                         |
        -----------------------------------------------------------

If you click on right button over "source" window, all other windows are
closed. Click again to get them back.

Instructions are available in "Help" page, in Emacs.
Click on right button over "menu" window, and select "Help" in popup menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick start
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory from which emacs is launched is important: it stands as the root
directory during emacs session.

If you work on a project - which is the main purpose of Emacs-IDE - you should
always run emacs from the root directory of your project.

When you first run emacs for a project, click on right button over "menu"
window, and select "Create project".
