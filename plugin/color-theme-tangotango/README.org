* Installation instructions

** Package.el

=tangotango-theme= is available in [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][MELPA]]. You can add this repository by
following its [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing][installation instructions]].

To install =tangotango-theme=, just do :

: M-x package-install tangotango-theme

You can then try it with =M-x load-theme=. If you want to load it
automatically on startup, add the following to your init file :

: (load-theme 'tangotango t)  

** Manual (Emacs 24)

Emacs 24 features native color theming, and as such you don't need any third
party package or extension.

1. Download =tangotango-theme.el= from [[https://github.com/juba/color-theme-tangotango/raw/master/tangotango-theme.el][github]] and save it to your =~/.emacs.d= directory
2. Try it with =M-x load-theme=
3. If you like it, just add the following line to your =.emacs= :

: (load-theme 'tangotango t)

If you prefer to place your theme files in another directory, you can just add
something like the following in your =.emacs= before loading the theme :

: (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/color-theme-tangotango")

** Emacs 23

With Emacs 23 you need to use the =color-theme= package :

1. Download and install the =color-theme= emacs package either via your linux distribution or [[http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme/#sec5][via the source tarball]]
2. Download and install =color-theme-tangotango.el= from [[http://github.com/juba/color-theme-tangotango/raw/master/color-theme-tangotango.el][github]]
3. Make sure that both =color-theme.el= and =color-theme-tangotango.el= are in your load path

There are several ways to load the tangotango color theme from your =.emacs=, as
documented on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme][emacswiki]]. The way I currently use should work for a daemonized
emacs and allows the selection of different themes for GUI or console based
frames :

: (require 'color-theme)
: (setq color-theme-load-all-themes nil)
: 
: (require 'color-theme-tangotango)
: 
: ;; select theme - first list element is for windowing system, second is for console/terminal
: ;; Source : http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme#toc9
: (setq color-theme-choices 
:       '(color-theme-tangotango color-theme-tangotango))
: 
: ;; default-start
: (funcall (lambda (cols)
:     	   (let ((color-theme-is-global nil))
:     	     (eval 
:     	      (append '(if (window-system))
:     		      (mapcar (lambda (x) (cons x nil)) 
:     			      cols)))))
:     	 color-theme-choices)
: 
: ;; test for each additional frame or console
: (require 'cl)
: (fset 'test-win-sys 
:       (funcall (lambda (cols)
:     		 (lexical-let ((cols cols))
:     		   (lambda (frame)
:     		     (let ((color-theme-is-global nil))
: 		       ;; must be current for local ctheme
: 		       (select-frame frame)
: 		       ;; test winsystem
: 		       (eval 
: 			(append '(if (window-system frame)) 
: 				(mapcar (lambda (x) (cons x nil)) 
: 					cols)))))))
:     	       color-theme-choices ))
: ;; hook on after-make-frame-functions
: (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'test-win-sys)
: 
: (color-theme-tangotango)

Note that I also had to add a (color-theme-tangotango) line at the end of my
=.gnus= file in order to apply the color theme to Gnus.
