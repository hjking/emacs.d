;; To use this package, simply put it in a file called "systemc-mode.el" in
;; a Lisp directory known to Emacs (see `load-path').
;;
;; Byte-compile the file (in the systemc-mode.el buffer, enter dired with C-x d
;; then press B yes RETURN)
;;
;; Put these lines in your ~/.emacs or site's site-start.el file (excluding
;; the START and END lines):
;;
;;  ---INSTALLER-SITE-START---
;;  ;; Systemc mode
;;  (autoload 'systemc-mode "systemc-mode" "Mode for SystemC files." t)
;;  (setq auto-mode-alist (append (list '("\\.sp$" . systemc-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
;;  ---INSTALLER-SITE-END---

;;; History:
;;
;; Changes in Emacs22 have made it difficult to keep up with new mode
;; requirements.  Therefore this mode has been stripped to just call
;; c++-mode.  This may be improved in the future.  Old versions with
;; the removed functionality are available from the author or CPAN.
